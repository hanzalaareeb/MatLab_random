# MatLab_random
## In this Repo I am going to load all my MatLabd projects I did for Digital signal design projects.
(main reason is I want to keep them togather for future refrence.)

Included:- 
-Digital filter design to filter impulse noise using median filter.
-First I padded the Salt paper noise to the input signal using 1) inbuilt noise functions, 2) using random function to creat random impulse of of inconsistant density and then added the noise signal to input signal (the idea was to impose the noise signal on the input signal and creating a fair and *Idael* signal for median filter)
-but I was unable to add the noise signal to message signale.
